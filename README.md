# Zenscape

Zenscape is a personal project built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), designed to practice and showcase skills in **TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS**, while focusing on clean and modern **UI/UX** principles. This project serves as a playground to explore front-end development techniques, component-based architecture, and interactive design patterns.

Although it is a personal learning project and not a production-grade application, Zenscape represents a full effort to implement a complete, cohesive application structure. It includes modern tools and libraries such as:

- **ReactBits** – for prebuilt, customizable React components.
- **Framer Motion** – for smooth, dynamic animations and micro-interactions.
- **Tailwind CSS** – to create responsive, utility-first styling without compromising readability.
- **TypeScript** – for static type checking and safer code development.
- **ChatGPT assistance** – for ideas, coding guidance, and problem-solving support throughout development.

This project demonstrates practical use of **Next.js features**, including the `app` directory structure, metadata configuration, and font optimization using [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts). The goal was to maintain a **clean and intuitive interface**, while experimenting with interactive components and modern front-end techniques.

## Features and Highlights

- Fully responsive layout with attention to spacing, typography, and color.
- Modular component architecture for easy reusability and maintainability.
